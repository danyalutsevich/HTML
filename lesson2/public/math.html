    <h2>
        Linear Equations
    </h2>
    <p>
        A linear equation is any equation that can be written in the form
    </p>

    <h3 class="math">
        ax + b = 0
    </h3>

    <p>
        where <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> are real numbers and <i>x</i> is a variable. This form is sometimes called the
        standard form of a linear
        equation. Note that most linear equations will not start off in this form. Also, the variable may or may not be
        an <i>x</i>
        so don’t get too locked into always seeing an <i>x</i> there.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Quadratic Equation
    </h2>
    <p>
        The standard form of a quadratic equation looks like this:
    </p>
    <h3 class="math">
        ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0
    </h3>
    <p>
        where <i>a, b, c</i> are known values and <i>x</i> is the variable or unknown (we don't know it yet).
        Also,<i>a</i>
        can't be 0.
    </p>
    <h2>
        The area of a circle (A)
    </h2>
    <p>
        <i>π</i> (Pi) times the radius (<i>r</i>) squared:
    </p>

    <h3 class="math">
        A = π × r<sup>2</sup>
    </h3>
    <p>
        or, when you know the diameter (<i>D</i>):
    </p>
    <h3 class="math">
        A = π / 4) × D<sup>2</sup>
    </h3>
    <p>
        or, when you know the circumference (<i>C</i>):
    </p>
    <h3 class="math">
        A = C<sup>2</sup> / 4 × π
    </h3>
    <h2>
        Intersection
    </h2>
    <p>
        The intersection of two sets <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>, denoted by A ∩ B, is the set of all objects that are
        members of both the sets A and B. In symbols,
    </p>
    <h3 class="math">
        A ∩ B = { x : x ∈ A and x ∈ B }
    </h3>
    <p>
        That is, <i>x</i> is an element of the intersection A ∩ B if and only if <i>x</i> is both an element of <i>A</i> and an element
        of <i>B</i>.
    </p>
